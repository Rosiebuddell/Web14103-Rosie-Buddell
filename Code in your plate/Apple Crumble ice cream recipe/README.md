**Apple Crumble is a traditional desert, often served with custard or ice cream, but this recipe combines my family's favourite deserts into one dish.
This recipe does not include the use of an ice cream mixer.**




###Ingredients:

* 1 litre pot ofVanilla custard (from the finest range at Sainsbury's, Tesco or Waitrose. No Ambrosia!)
* 2 Bramley Apples (approx 500g in total)
* 25g unsalted butter
* 50g golden granulated sugar or demerara sugar
* 75g of plain flour
* 50g butter, chilled and cubed
* 50g golden caster sugar

###Step 1
Place the pot of fresh custard in the freezer for an hour whilst preparing the apple crumble mixture

###Step 2
Preheat the oven to gas mark 5.
Core and peel the apples, then cut into 1cm cubes. Melt the unsalted butter in a large pan, add the granulated or demerara sugar and cook over a medium heat until it resembles a toffee-coloured sauce. Add the chopped apples and cook for 5-7 minutes,or until the fruit is tender. Taste the mixture, it should be a little tart, but if it's too tart you can add moore sugar. Set aside to cool.

###Step 3
To make the crumble mixture, sift the plain flour and a pinch of salt into a bowl, add the chilled butter and rub in until it resembles crumbs. Add the sugar and work the mixture between your fingers until it starts to clumb together. Spread the mixture over a baking tray and place in the pre-heated oven for 10 minutes, or until the crumble is biscuit coloured.Set aside to cool.

###Step 4
Turn out the custard into a litre plastic box (a recyled ice cream tub works well) and give it a good stir to break up the ice crystals. Freeze again for an hour and a half, then stir agin to break up the crystals.

###Step 5
Add in the apple and crumble mix. It's easier to stir in the apple mixture first, and then following the same movements, stir in the crumble. Re-freeze for half an hour before serving.
